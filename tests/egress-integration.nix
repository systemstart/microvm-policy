# Multi-node integration test for the egress proxy (proxy/). The Go unit tests
# cover its logic in-process; this covers what they cannot — the real binary as
# a systemd service, reached over a network by a separate client, and chaining
# through an upstream "corporate" proxy. That chaining path had been only
# manually verifiable (no corporate proxy to point at in CI); here a second
# instance of our own proxy in log mode *is* the corporate proxy, and its audit
# log is the proof the traffic chained rather than dialing out directly.
#
# What the launcher does to the QEMU command line (restrict=on + guestfwd) is
# still out of reach — a nixosTest drives its own QEMU — so that hop stays a
# manual host check. Everything from the proxy inward is covered here.
#
# Topology:   client ──proxy(enforce)──corp(log, permissive)──upstream
# The proxy's HTTP(S)_PROXY points at corp, so every upstream dial — the opaque
# CONNECT leg and the reverse-proxy leg both — goes through it.
