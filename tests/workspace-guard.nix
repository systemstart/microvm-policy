# The workspace write-guard (modules/workspace.nix) in its opt-out shape:
# defaultOn, repoDepth and the AppArmor layer, confining the user manager
# (user@) that the workload runs under. Two guests, identical but for the
# state file: `guarded` has none (default on), `optout` says
# WORKSPACE_GUARD=0.
#
# At boot (before the guard) a repository exists two levels down, with a
# hook directory, an .envrc and a .mcp.json; after boot the test clones a
# second one. Everything the test writes, it writes from the user manager
# (systemd-run --user), i.e. under the profile, the way the workload does.
#
# Asserted on `guarded`:
#   - the user manager runs under the profile (enforce);
#   - existing repository: a hook, its .git/config, .envrc, .githooks/ and
#     .claude/settings.json refused, the last three also by read-only binds;
#   - repository cloned after boot: clone and an ordinary commit work; a
#     hook (write, mkdir, rename onto, hard link, symlink), .envrc, .mcp.json,
#     .claude/commands/*, a directory renamed to .claude — refused;
#   - the documented limit holds as documented: the NEW repository's
#     .git/config is writable, and a directory renamed into place as a new
#     `.git` keeps its hooks/ (both asserted, so the documentation cannot
#     silently become false).
# On `optout`: the same writes succeed, under the open profile.
#
# `breakGuarded = true` seeds `guarded` with WORKSPACE_GUARD=0 too: the test
# must then FAIL.
