# Guest-side guard for workspace paths whose contents execute on the HOST
# later, which is why the VM boundary does not cover them: .git/hooks and
# .git/config run on the next host-side git invocation, .claude/commands,
# .claude/agents and .mcp.json are picked up by the next unsandboxed session
# that opens the directory, and .envrc runs under the host's direnv. A
# sandboxed session that can write these persists code past the VM teardown.
#
# Two layers, both off by default:
#
#   - read-only binds at boot (`paths`, at the workspace root and, with
#     `repoDepth`, in every repository found below it). They cover what exists
#     at boot, including a repository's .git/config, and pin existing .git
#     directories in place. They cannot cover what does not exist yet.
#   - an AppArmor profile (`apparmor.*`) for the units the guest workload
#     runs under: writes to the `denyPatterns` names are refused anywhere under
#     the workspace, at every syscall, so a repository cloned or created after
#     boot is covered the moment it exists — no watcher, no race. What it
#     cannot cover by construction: a NEW repository's .git/config and a
#     directory renamed into place as a new `.git` (git init and clone must be
#     able to create both, and a name rule cannot tell git from anything else
#     that writes the same path).
#
# Whether the guard is on is the state file's WORKSPACE_GUARD: opt-in ("1")
# by default, because straight denial breaks a workflow some consumers use —
# asking the agent to write a project skill or register an MCP server — or,
# with `defaultOn`, opt-out ("0") for guests less trusted than the machines
# the workspace reaches. Defence in depth, not a boundary.
#
# The same module carries WORKSPACE_MODE=ephemeral: the workspace
# becomes a guest-side overlay whose writes never reach the host — the
# complement of the guard. Passthrough stays the default: instant host-visible
# edits are the current contract and most of the point of virtiofs.
#
# Part of the microvm-policy layer — see modules/policy.nix for the options
# that decouple it from any one microVM's layout.
